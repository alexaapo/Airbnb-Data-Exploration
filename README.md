# AirBnB-Data-Exploration
Here we analyze data (of 2019) from AirBnB and we implement a Recommendation System. 

# Summary 
In first section of this project we answer to a lot of queries, which are based on exploration of data, like examination of prices through months or find frequency of each room_type in each neighbourhood of Athens.

In second section of this project we built a Recommendation System, which gets a specific apartment, for example A, and an integer n and then after processing returns n most similar apartments compared with A. 

# Note 
There is a file map.html in which we can observe locations of apartments no matter of room_type.
